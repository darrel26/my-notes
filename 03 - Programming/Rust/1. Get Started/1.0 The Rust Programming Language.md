## **Who Rust is For?**
Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. 
## **Why Rust?**
- **Performance**
	- **Speed**: Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++ due to its low-level control over system resources. The `iter().sum()` operation in Rust is highly optimized, and the absence of a garbage collector means there's no runtime overhead impacting performance.
	- **Memory Efficiency**: Rust’s ownership system ensures that memory is used efficiently without unnecessary allocations or deallocations, which can be crucial in performance-critical applications.
- **Reliability**
	- **Memory Safety:** Rust’s ownership model enforces strict rules around borrowing and references. In the example above, you don’t need to manually manage memory or worry about issues like dangling pointers or buffer overflows. Rust's compiler ensures that the code adheres to these safety rules at compile time.
	- **Thread Safety:** If you were to extend this program to work with threads, Rust’s concurrency model helps ensure that data races are eliminated through its ownership system and type guarantees.
- **Productivity**
	- **Helpful Compiler:** Rust's compiler provides detailed error messages and suggestions. If you had any issues with the code (e.g., incorrect type usage), the compiler would guide you to the solution.
	- **Tooling:** Rust’s tooling ecosystem is robust. The `cargo` tool (Rust’s package manager and build system) simplifies building, testing, and managing dependencies. For instance, you can run `cargo run` to compile and execute the program in one step.

## **Memory Safety and Zero-Cost Abstractions**
It is graced with the feature of “memory safety without garbage collection,” an attribute that makes Rust one of a kind. Rust’s memory management features even support concurrent programming, providing options for shared and mutable state access that ensure thread safety while reducing the risk of thread unsafety.

Zero-cost abstraction is another key concept Rust implements. In general, abstractions in programming languages allow code to be written at a high level (like in Python), while being able to run at a low level (like in C).

Rust aims to provide many useful abstractions, such as iterators and closures, that don’t sacrifice runtime performance. This means you can write high-level code in Rust, and the Rust compiler will optimize it to run as fast as manually written low-level code.
