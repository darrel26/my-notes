# **Before Jump-in**

- Rust is a low-level language requiring prerequisite knowledge of CS concepts, such as memory regions (stack, heap, static memory), memory allocation and deallocation, and understanding of concurrency and parallelism.
- Familiarity with other low-level languages, specifically C and C++, is beneficial, as Rust builds on their features and solves some of their problems, like the ownership system and error handling.
- Best learning resources include Harvard CS50 lectures, YouTube memory management playlist, and Rust-specific resources like The Rust Book, Rustlings GitHub repo, and idiomatic Rust GitHub repo.
- Productivity will slow down initially due to Rust's strong typing and low-level complexity, but it will improve over time and make developers better by optimizing both runtime performance and code quality.
- Rust is not just hype and is here to stay, with a growing community and industry adoption.

# **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)**
Programming technique which binds the life cycle of a resource that must be acquired before use (allocated heap memory, thread of execution, open socket, open file, locked mutex, disk space, database connection) all the concepts are related based on the limited supply
## **How does it work?**
1. Resource Acquisition: when a resource is created, it's associated within an object.
2. Resource Ownership: the object who owns the resource.
3. Automatic Resource Release: when the object goes out of scope, its destructor is called. This destructor automatically releases the associated resource
## **Concepts**
1. Ownership Rules
	Rust's ownership rules ensure memory safety by enforcing strict rules about how values can be used and owned. Each value in Rust has a single owner, and ownership is transferred when values are passed between functions.
3. Algebraic Data Types
	ADTs allow you to define complex data structures by combining simpler types. Common ADTs in Rust include `enum` and `struct`.
4. Polymorphism
	Allows you to write generic code that can work with different types. Rust supports two main forms of polymorphism: generic types and traits.
	- Generic Functions
5. Async Programming
	Rust's async/await syntax makes it easier to write asynchronous code, which is essential for non-blocking I/O operations.
6. Meta Programming
	1. Macros
		Allow you to write code that generates other code. Rust has two types of macros: declarative and procedural.
	2. Hygienic
		Hygienic macros are a safer and more powerful form of macros that avoid naming conflicts and other potential issues.

## **Memory Safety and Zero-Cost Abstractions**
It is graced with the feature of “memory safety without garbage collection,” an attribute that makes Rust one of a kind. Rust’s memory management features even support concurrent programming, providing options for shared and mutable state access that ensure thread safety while reducing the risk of thread unsafety.

Zero-cost abstraction is another key concept Rust implements. In general, abstractions in programming languages allow code to be written at a high level (like in Python), while being able to run at a low level (like in C).

Rust aims to provide many useful abstractions, such as iterators and closures, that don’t sacrifice runtime performance. This means you can write high-level code in Rust, and the Rust compiler will optimize it to run as fast as manually written low-level code.
