# Introduction to Deployments

Heterogeneous deployments involve connecting distinct infrastructure environments or regions to meet specific technical or operational needs. These deployments are often referred to as:

- **Hybrid**: A combination of on-premises and public cloud environments.
- **Multi-cloud**: Utilizing multiple public cloud environments.
- **Public-private**: Combining aspects of public and private environments.

## Challenges in Single-Environment Deployments

Deployments restricted to a single environment or region can face several issues:

- **Maxed Out Resources**: Limited compute, networking, and storage resources in on-premises environments.
- **Limited Geographic Reach**: Traffic may need to travel globally to reach a central location, affecting users who are geographically distant.
- **Limited Availability**: Web-scale traffic patterns can challenge applications in terms of fault tolerance and resilience.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Platform and infrastructure abstractions may hinder the portability of applications.
- **Inflexible Resources**: Resources may be restricted to specific compute, storage, or networking options.

## Benefits of Heterogeneous Deployments

Heterogeneous deployments address the challenges listed above but require careful planning. They must be architected using programmatic and deterministic methods to ensure reliability and prevent failures. Ad-hoc or one-off procedures can lead to issues such as data loss or dropped traffic.
## Common Scenarios for Heterogeneous Deployments

1. **Multi-cloud Deployments**
2. **Fronting On-Premises Data**
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) Processes**
## Lab Exercises
The lab exercises will practice common use cases for heterogeneous deployments and utilize well-architected approaches with Kubernetes and other infrastructure resources.

**Create a cluster with 3 nodes**

```shell
gcloud container clusters create bootcamp \
  --machine-type e2-small \
  --num-nodes 3 \
  --scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,storage-rw"
```
