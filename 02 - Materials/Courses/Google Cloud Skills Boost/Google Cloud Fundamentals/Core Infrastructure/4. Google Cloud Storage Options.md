	![[Pasted image 20240915194734.png]]
	
	With object versioning enabled, you can list the archived versions of an object, restore an object to an older state, or permanently delete a version of an object, as needed.
- **Key Features:**
    - **Immutability:** New versions created for changes.
    - **Versioning:** Tracks object changes.
    - **Access Control:** IAM roles and ACLs for security.
    - **Lifecycle Management:** Automates data management based on access patterns.
- **Use Cases:**
    - Storing media files, sensor data, and backup data.
    - Managing large datasets efficiently.

### Cloud Storage: Storage Classes and Data Transfer

- **Storage Classes:**

    - **Standard:** For frequently accessed data.
    - **Nearline:** For infrequently accessed data (monthly or less).
    - **Coldline:** For infrequently accessed data (quarterly or less).
    - **Archive:** For data accessed less than yearly.
